Requirements: 
Python 3.7 or newer: The code uses libraries compatible with Python 3


You will need the following libraries:
numpy>=1.20.0
matplotlib>=3.4.0
scipy>=1.6.0
scikit-image>=0.18.0
PyTorch

Hardware Requirements
CPU: The code will run on a CPU, but training will be slower.
GPU (Optional): To accelerate training, use a GPU with CUDA support. Ensure PyTorch is installed with GPU capabilities.

Dataset
The MNIST dataset is automatically downloaded to the ./data directory when running the code. Ensure you have enough disk space (approximately 15 MB).

Environment
A Python IDE (e.g., PyCharm, VS Code) or a notebook environment like Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
For GPU usage, ensure the correct version of PyTorch with CUDA is installed. Use the PyTorch installation guide to select the appropriate version
